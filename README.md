# Group 37 Game Project

## Overview
This repository contains the work of **Group 37** for our Prototype 4 puzzle game.

## Description
Our prompt is "transformer" and dread. Some mechanics we wanted to explore are timing based on player movement across tiles, creatures that move in specific patterns/intervals, transforming enemies into other creatures, and interactable environment elements.
